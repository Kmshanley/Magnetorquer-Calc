#Minimum gap that must be present between traces (mm)
GapBetweenTraces = 0.13

# Thickness of PCB copper layers in oz
OuterLayerThickness = 1

#### There should be no need to change the following constants: ####

# Copper resistivity in ohm-meters
CopperResistivity = 1.77e-8

# How vertically thick the trace is (in mm) per oz of thickness
TraceThicknessPerOz = 0.0348
